Check how many times you've dirty-flagged someone on Lichess.

A dirty flag is currently defined as a win on time where the position at the end of the game was drawn (up to +-0.1) or losing for you. I'm open to suggestions for improving this.

Things to improve:

- Definition of a dirty flag
  - Change it so that you need to be losing or in a drawn position for 80% of the last phase of the game (whether that's the midgame or endgame -- games that don't make it past the opening don't count)
  - Is there a way to acquire a lot of games that people thought were dirty flags?
- Stand it up as a web app so that people can use it more easily?
  - Sign in with Lichess?
- Chess.com support
