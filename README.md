Check how many times you've dirty-flagged someone on Lichess.

Things to improve:

- Definition of a dirty flag. If you're winning until the last move, then blunder but win on time, does that count as a dirty flag?
- Detecting if a win came because your opponent DC'd or left the game instead of timing out?
- Make it work for games without a Lichess analysis. Maybe a locally hosted chess engine to analyze the final board state?
- Stand it up as a web app so that people can use it more easily?
  - Sign in with Lichess?
